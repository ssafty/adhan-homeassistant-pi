# Adhan HomeAssistant Pi

[![Go](https://github.com/ssafty/adhan-homeassistant-pi/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ssafty/adhan-homeassistant-pi/actions/workflows/go.yml) [![Docker Image CI](https://github.com/ssafty/adhan-homeassistant-pi/actions/workflows/docker-image.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ssafty/adhan-homeassistant-pi/actions/workflows/docker-image.yml)

This server runs Adhan 5 times a day by switching on the speakers before the
adhan and switching them off directly after. Thus, using raspberry pi's 2W
instead of having the speakers on (~50W) for a long period of time.
